    "In nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula is a formula for calculating the\n",
    "approximate nuclear binding energy $B$ of an atomic nucleus with atomic number $Z$\n",
    "and mass number $A$. The formula looks like this:\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "where, in units of millions of electron volts (MeV), the constants are $a_1 =\n",

    "Create yet another function that takes a single argument, Z, and finds the value of A at which the binding energy per nucleon is largest. You are aided in this problem in the fact that A is discrete; you can simply check all reasonable values without worrying about mimizing a function or any such thing. You should be able to easily determine the minimum value for A. If you consult a table of nuclides, you'll see some elements have nuclides, with measured half lives, with A > 2Z, so in this exercise use A = 3Z as an upper limit. I encourage you to go verify this!
